Definitions:

"I", "me" and so on defines the Licensor, the holder of the Copyright etc. to this Project.
"You" defines any Licensee who is willing to use this Project
"This Project" defines the target of the License, in other words source code written by me under this License.

so in short you can  use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of this project, BUT:

* You Have to make the source code of this project available to everyone 
    who has access to it or any derivative works (no matter in what form or medium, or with/without modifications)
    based upon this project.
  * This does NOT mean that you have to make the entire source of derivative works available, 
    just files pertaining to this Project, including any modifications to it.
  * You are also required to state any changes to this Project,
    making it easy to understand what has been changed from the original.
  * Access over any networks like the internet counts as having access to the project, 
    therefore anyone who is able to view web pages or similar things that are made with this project 
    or derivative works including this project has a right to get the Source of this Project.
  * This does not include the values (especially secret values) of any config files, 
    although a "cleaned" version of the config file with dummy/test values, 
    showing what kind of values should be inserted has to be given as part of the source code.
  * All Files pertaining to this project modified, or not on whatever medium, shall stay under 
    this License and are unaffected by the License of any Derivative works, 
    UNLESS you have an explicit written consent from me.

* Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
